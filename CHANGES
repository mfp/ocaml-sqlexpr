0.9.1 (unreleased)
==================
* fix Sqlexpr_sqlite_lwt nested transaction bug: partial rollback not
  performed

0.9.0  (2018-05-12)
=====
* migrate to jbuilder, move the PPX and Camlp4 extensions to separate packages
  ppx_sqlexpr and pa_sqlexpr (Freyr).
* fix stack overflows when iterating/fold/selecting over many rows when
  using Sqlexpr_concurrency.Id concurrency.
* multiple fixes to work with newer versions of Lwt and lwt_ppx.

Backwards compatibility is provided for the time being as follows:
* sqlexpr depends on ppx_sqlexpr, and a sqlexpr.ppx alias is provided
* if estring was installed (required if sqlexpr.syntax was being used),
  sqlexpr.syntax will also be installed
* installing pa_sqlexpr will also install its estring dependency, and
  cause a sqlexpr rebuild, so that sqlexpr.syntax is provided

These mean that it is still possible to (wherever it was before) compile e.g.
with

   ocamlfind ocamlopt -package sqlexpr,sqlexpr.syntax -syntax camlp4o -c ...

but in the future the sqlexpr.syntax and sqlexpr.ppx aliases will be dropped,
so it is recommended to:

1) opam install ppx_sqlexpr and/or pa_sqlexpr explicitly
2) start using the ppx_sqlexpr instead of sqlexpr.ppx and pa_sqlexpr instead
   of sqlexpr.syntax in your build system.

* camlp4 syntax extension now optional (Josh Allmann)

0.7.0
